TechSupport - the DodgySoft Technical support system.

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition
   David J. Barnes and Michael KÃ¶lling

This project is discussed in chapter 6.


This project implements a technical support system for customers of the 
DodgySoft software company. Users can describe their software problems and 
get advice instantly!

The idea is based on Eliza - a famous program described by Joseph Weizenbaum 
in 1966. (Do a web search for "Eliza" and "Weizenbaum" if you want to know 
more about this.)

In fact, it is much more primitive than Eliza. But that's enough to match the 
quality of many software companies' technical support advice...  ;-)

To start this program, create a SupportSystem object and execute the "start" 
method.

Then start describing your problem by typing in the terminal window.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate and study library classes, such 
as ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, and Random.



24) A map is An object that maps keys to values. its like i real life map its tell u where to look with keys to a specific value .u decide which key goes to which value
a hashmap is like a map but permits  null values and the null key and is unsynchorized . i think its a like the map but more complicated for harder jobs.  

25)i dont think i understand the question complictly . its almost every method like containskey, containsvalue, get,put like that . yes there is problem using the same types 

26) use the size method

28) its replaces the old key

29) they both work


30) use the contains key method

31) its ays null

32) use the keyset method
